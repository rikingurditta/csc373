# Linear Programming

## Linear inequalities

## Convexity

A set $S$ is **convex** if for every $x, y \in S$ and every $\lambda \in [0, 1]$, $\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y \in S$.

A **vertex** of $S$ is a point that cannot be written as a *strict* convex combination of any two other points.

## Certificate of Optimality

Suppose you design an LP solver that can solve very large problems. Now you want to convince someone that your LP solver is optimal without showing them the code.
